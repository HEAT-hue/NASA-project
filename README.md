NASA-Project-Rebuild
Rebuilding NASA project from ZTM course

Intention
My intention for this project is to rebuild a project from the Zero to Mastery’s Complete NodeJS Developer course. I will be doing this in order to practice what I have learned in order to aid in my retention of the information and skills.

While going through the project from scratch I will be doing my best to document the journey and the thought processes in this README.

NASA Website Overview
This website serves as a launch scheduler and a record of upcoming and previous launches.

Several potentially habitable exoplanets have been identified. Future missions to these planets will have their launches scheduled through here.

The Project Mission
I’ve been given all the files for a front-end that needs a functioning back-end.

I will be using NodeJS and MongoDB to setup a functioning API that will accomplish a few jobs:

Schedule Launches (POST)
Provide data for Upcoming Launches (GET)
Abort Launches (DELETE)
View Previous Launches (GET)
